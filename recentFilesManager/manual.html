		<h1>DINTDT's Recent Files Manager</h1>
		<p><i>RFM</i> is a plugin designed to easily manage the list of recent
		files that Krita has opened. By default, Krita only allows you to clear
		the list, but not manage individual entries in this list.</p>
		<p>This plugin provides a docker that shows each recent file, allows
		you to reorder them and/or delete them individually.</p>
		<p>The "Update List" button will reload the list of recent files. Use this to
		view new files you've opened, and to fix the list if it ever gets
		desynched.</p>
